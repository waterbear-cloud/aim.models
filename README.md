aim.models: Semantic cloud infrastructure configuration file format and object models

# Developing

Install this package with your Python tool of choice. Typically set-up a virtualenv
and pip install the dependencies in there:

    python -m venv env

    ./env/bin/pip install -e .

There are unit tests using PyTest. If you are using VS Code you can turn on the
"Py Test Enabled" setting and run "Discover Unit Tests" command.

ToDo: Set-up a CLI to run the test suite and run this suite automatically on commits to master.
