  They can be used by Services that want to set-up Resources in a multi-account, multi-region manner.

### Changed

- CloudTrail defines CloudWatchLogGroup as a sub-object rather than an paco.ref.

- Alarms have `get_alarm_actions_paco_refs` renamed from `get_alarm_actions` as alarms can only provide

- Modified NatGateway segments to aim references

### Fixed

- Invariants were not being check for resources. Invariants need to be checked by the
  loader if they are not contained in a `zope.schema.Object` field, which will run the
  check behind the scenes.

------------------

### Added

 - IVPCPeering and IVPCPeeringRoute have been added to the model for VPC Peering support.

 - IS3BucketPolicy now has `principal` and `condition` fields.
   `principal` can be either a Key-Value dictionary, where the key is either 'AWS', 'Service', etc.
   and the value can be either a String or a List. It is an alternate to the `aws` field, which will
   remain for setting simpler AWS-only principals.
   The `condition` field is a Key-Value dictionary of Key-Value filters.

   logging is under the top level `cw_logging` key. The schema has been completely reworked
   so that LogGroups and LogSets are properly modelled.
